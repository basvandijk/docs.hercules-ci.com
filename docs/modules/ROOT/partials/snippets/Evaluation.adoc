= Evaluation

Evaluation is the first step when it comes to building your project. It is performed by your agent as follows:

. At the top-level of your repository, the agent will search for a Nix file to
   evaluate in the following order: `nix/ci.nix`, `ci.nix` or `default.nix`
// TODO: link to how pinning is done
. `NIX_PATH` will be empty. Make sure you pin nixpkgs and not rely on `<nixpkgs>`
    search path. This is to ensure reproducability and purity also when it comes to nixpkgs
. If any of the attributes fail to evaluate, job evaluation phase will be marked as failed
   and error messages will be shown inline per attribute
